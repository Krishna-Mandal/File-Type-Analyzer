summary: "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Files come in all possible formats: we usually see\
  \ it specified in their names. Even if the file type was manual changed or even\
  \ removed, information about the type is always contained within the file. And in\
  \ this project, you will write a tool that will extract this info to determine the\
  \ type of the file. You&rsquo;ll try out different algorithms to solve this problem,\
  \ and will see for yourself how using different algorithms will change the speed\
  \ of the tool.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href=\"https://hyperskill.org/projects/244?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card\"\
