<h2>Finding and starting a thread</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>Implement a function that takes an array of threads, finds the first thread that has not been started yet, and starts it.</p> 
  <p>The found thread must be terminated before the implemented function is completed.</p> 
  <p>The testing system will give you some hints throwing exceptions in the main thread, like:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Found thread must be terminated before ending the implemented function</code></pre>
